# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Communication Style

Use direct, technical language in all responses. Avoid:
- Marketing-style adjectives (e.g., "powerful", "seamless", "amazing", "robust")
- Superlatives and hype language (e.g., "excellent", "perfect", "fantastic")
- Unnecessary enthusiasm or exclamation marks
- Sales-oriented descriptions

Instead, provide:
- Clear, factual technical descriptions
- Objective analysis and explanations
- Direct statements about what code does
- Straightforward problem-solving approaches

Example of preferred style:
- ❌ "I've successfully created an amazing new feature with robust error handling!"
- ✅ "Added description field to hosts table with HTML support. Includes API endpoint and UI for editing."

## Code Documentation

- Document technical decisions and implementation details
- Explain why something was done a particular way when relevant
- Keep comments technical and factual
- Focus on functionality, not salesmanship
