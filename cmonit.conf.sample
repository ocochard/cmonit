#
# All settings are optional - CLI flags override config file values.
# If neither config file nor CLI flag is provided, built-in defaults are used.

# Network Configuration

# Password format: "plain" or "bcrypt"
# - "plain": Store password in plain text (less secure)
# - "bcrypt": Store password as bcrypt hash (recommended for production)
# Default: "plain"
#
# To generate a bcrypt hash:
#   ./cmonit -hash-password "your-password"

# Password format: "plain" or "bcrypt"
# - "plain": Store password in plain text (less secure)
# - "bcrypt": Store password as bcrypt hash (recommended for production)
# Default: "plain"
#
# To generate a bcrypt hash:
#   ./cmonit -hash-password "your-password"
#
